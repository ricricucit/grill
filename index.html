This project born by chance, while I was dusting my rusty coding skills, aiming to design more in browser and less in illustrator.<br/>
I tried some famous and unknown grid frameworks available on internet, it was horrible, i felt like i was designing a book with excel instead indesign.<br/>
So i started to write this tiny sass library to use for my responsive prototypes.<br/>
Here we are, it is not finished or ready for the distribution, but is something.<br/>
Below you can find some examples.<br/><br/>
p.s.<br/>
I know I should comment the code.

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}

        <!--<span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span> -->
        
        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </h2>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.categories }}</span>
